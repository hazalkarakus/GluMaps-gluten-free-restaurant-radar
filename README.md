# GluMaps-gluten-free-restaurant-radar
GluMaps / Gluten-Free-Restaurant-Radar is a location-based web app inspired by the lack of tools for people with celiac disease to find gluten-free places. Built only with Python using a vibe-coding approach, it uses Streamlit, Overpass API, Geocoder, and Pandas. Designed in Figma and open to future improvements.

Longer Description:
Gluten-Free Radar is a location-based web application built to help people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity find nearby places that may offer gluten-free options. The idea for this project came from noticing how difficult it still is to quickly see gluten-free restaurants or cafés in one place, and how there is no simple, dedicated app or website that focuses on this need.

This project is a basic first execution, intentionally developed using only Python, as my main goal was to strengthen my backend and data-handling skills. I followed a vibe-coding approach—experimenting, iterating, and learning through building—while keeping the implementation simple and functional. The app was built using Streamlit for the interface, Overpass API for OpenStreetMap data, Geocoder for automatic location detection, and Pandas for data processing and ranking. Before coding, I also designed the layout and flow in Figma to visualize the website clearly, and the final result closely matches those initial designs.

This project is fully improvable, and I see it as a foundation that can later be expanded with better filtering, user feedback, and richer gluten-free data. For now, it represents both a practical solution idea and a hands-on learning experience.
