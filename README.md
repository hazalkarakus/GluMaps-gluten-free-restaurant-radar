# GluMaps-gluten-free-restaurant-radar
GluMaps / Gluten-Free-Restaurant-Radar is a location-based web app inspired by the lack of tools for people with celiac disease to find gluten-free places. Built only with Python using a vibe-coding approach, it uses Streamlit, Overpass API, Geocoder, and Pandas. Designed in Figma and open to future improvements.
